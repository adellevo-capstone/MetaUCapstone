# Tangerine

Capstone project for Meta University — web app to help simplify the process of event planning for individuals and groups.

## 1. User Roles

* Event planner: A user who is seeking to plan a group or individual event.
* Event invitee: A user who is filling out an event invitation from an event planner.

## 2. User Personas

* [Event planner] Samantha is a social butterfly who just moved to a new city. She constantly makes plans with different people, so a potential pain point for her would be having to create a new group in the app every time she plans an event.
* [Event planner] Jamie is a college student who hangs out with her friends every weekend. Her main motiviation for using the app is to easily plan dinner outings with her friends on a regular basis. Since Jamie's friends all have very busy schedules, a potential pain point for Jamie might be having to constantly edit the time slot windows of her events.
* [Event planner]: Jasmine is a foodie who loves exploring new places to eat. Since she constantly tries new places, it might not take too long before the app's recommendations start to repeat. 
* [Event invitee]: Abigail is an elderly woman who was just invited to a birthday dinner by her granddaughter. She isn't very proficient with technology, so some pain points for her would be figuring out how to create a profile and navigate the app in general.
* [Event invitee]: Bella is a busy full-time employee who frequently gets invited to events. Because of her job, she generally doesn't have free time, so a pain point for her would probably be having to ask the event planner to edit their event's time slots.
